# js-starter with react - Manmeet Gujral

I used react to create app, note, and addbar components that work with each other to create a noteboard that supports markdown, dragging, deleting, and editing. Everything worked well once I completed the lab. It was tough to understand how react works and I received a lot of help from Alex Beals. I attempted no extra credit.
