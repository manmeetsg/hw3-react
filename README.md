# js-starter with react - Manmeet Gujral

### Part 1
I used react to create app, note, and addbar components that work with each other to create a noteboard that supports markdown, dragging, deleting, and editing. Everything worked well once I completed the lab. It was tough to understand how react works and I received a lot of guidance from Alex Beals. I attempted no extra credit.

### Part 2
I used firebase to add a backend to my site that updated notes and stored them such that the same site would have the same notes in multiple browsers. I recieved a lot of guidance from Alex Beals. I attempted no extra credit.
